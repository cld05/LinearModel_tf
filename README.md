# LinearModel_tf
Creation of a simple linear model using tensor flow.

A simple linear model is created using tensorflow.
Using the MNIST dataset the model is trained in order to classify images.
In particular, the linear model classifies black and white pictures of single handwritten numbers. The algorithm classifies the output in ten classes, that is, digits from 0 to 9.
